## Introduction

_pantcl4r_ is a simple R only  package  which uses only standard R packages, so has no
external dependency except for the tools you might want to integrate into your
Markdown  document. It is thought as fast simple  drop-in  replacement  for the
RMarkdown package in cases where you can't install all the required tools and
packages easily for instance if you are working on a kiosk-mode  computer like
in the seminar rooms of the  University. It is not fully  compatible  yet with
R-Markdown so should be mainly used for demonstration purposes.

Below you find example code for the package pantcl4r for different programming
or diagram  languages  like R, Python,  Tcl, C++,  GraphViz  dot,  PlantUML or
diagram languages supported by the kroki web service. 

## Document processing

The  idea  of the  process  is that  you  create  a file  with  embedded  code
statements  and then the file is  converted  to a HTML file where the embedded
statements are executed and the results of the code execution is added as well
to the output. That way you can combine  your text for your  article or thesis
with R code and  updating  your results is very easy in case your data gets an
update. So the pipeline  within your R console using the function  `pantcl` of
the pantcl4r package is as follows:

```

+-------------+                                        +--------------+   
|             |  pantcl('article.Rmd','article.Rmd')   |              |
| article.Rmd +--------------------------------------> | article.html |  
|             |                                        |              |
+-------------+                                        +--------------+
```


## R examples

Let's start with a simple print  statement  using R (replace the triple single
quotes with triple backticks in the examples below, the single quotes are used
to avoid inpterpretation by the package for the code examples

```
'''{r}
x=1
print(x)
'''
```

This is the output:

```{r}
x=1
print(x)
```

Using the code chunk option `echo=FALSE` we can avoid showing the source code.

```
'''{r echo=FALSE}
x=1
print(x)
'''
```

This is the output:

```{r echo=FALSE}
x=1
print(x)
```

To even hide the output you could use the optin  `results="hide"`.  That would
allow you to perform some  computations but hide the details in the ouput. For
instance in a scientific  article you only like to present the results but not
exactly how they are computed.

```
'''{r echo=FALSE results="hide"}
x=x+1
print(x)
'''
```

Here the result:

```{r echo=FALSE results="hide"}
x=x+1
print(x)
```

You should see ... Nothing! But x is now: `r x`!

Now we continue  with a simple plot, the easiest way is to open a png and later
add the Markdown code for the image.

```
 '''{r}
 png("iris.png",width=800,height=500)
 data(iris)
 par(mfrow=c(1,2),mai=rep(0.8,4))
 plot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Sepal.Length,
     col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
 plot(iris$Petal.Width~iris$Petal.Length,
    col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
 dev.off()
 '''

 ! [] (iris.png) (remove spaces)
```

Here is the output:

```{r eval=TRUE}
png("iris.png",width=800,height=500)
data(iris)
par(mfrow=c(1,2),mai=rep(0.8,4))
plot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Sepal.Length,
    col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
plot(iris$Petal.Width~iris$Petal.Length,
    col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
dev.off()
```

![](iris.png)

Let's  continue with a little  table. The  package  comes with a
command  df2md which can be used to display  Data Frames and  Matrices. If you
have the knitr package installed you could as well use knitr:kable instead.

```
'''{r results="asis"}
df2md(head(iris))
'''
```

See especially the code chunk option `results="asis"` which indicates that the
putput  should be embedded  already as Markdown  code ready for  conversion to
HTML. Here the result:


```{r results="asis"}
df2md(head(iris))
```


Last but not  least, often  you like to inline  R-expressions  in your text to
display results of R commands directly within your text.


The dataset iris has `r nrow(iris)` plants.

To summarize this section. We have either 

- code chunks in tiple backtick fenced code block
- inline code expressions with single backticks 

The following code chunk arguments were discussed:

- echo - show the code chunk code, default: TRUE
- results - show the results (default: 'show', possible as well 'hide' or 'asis'

## Graphviz example

The  following  code  requires  the  GraphViz  tools to be  available  and the
applications  dot or neato must be  available  in one folder  belonging to the
PATH  variable.  Usually on a Linux system you install  these tools using your
package manager like this:

```
### Fedora
sudo dnf install graphviz
### Debian systems like Ubuntu
sudo apt install graphviz
```

After you installed these tools you can embed and display GraphViz code within
your Markdown documents like this:

```{.dot eval=true}
digraph { 
    node[style=filled,fillcolor=skyblue];
    rankdir="LR";
    A -> B; 
}
```

## PlantUML code

The  following  code  requires  the [PlantUML](https://www.plantuml.com) application  and the  executable
_plantuml_  must be  available in one folder  belonging to the PATH  variable.
Usually on a Linux system you install  these tools using your package  manager
like this:

```
### Fedora
sudo dnf install plantuml
### Debian systems like Ubuntu
sudo apt install plantuml
```

After you installed  this tool you can embed and display  PlantUML code within
your Markdown documents like this:

```{.puml eval=true}
@startuml
class A { }
class B { }
class C { }
A -> B 
B - C
@enduml
```

## Python example

```{.pipe pipe="python3" eval=TRUE}
print("Hello Python 2023\n",flush=True)
for i in range(0,5):
    print(i,flush=True)
```

Inline Python: After the loop the variable value of i is `py i`!

## Kroki Diagrams

The  [Kroki](https://kroki.io/)  webservices  allows  you to  create  diagrams
without  installing  software  on your own  machine  and  should  work with an
internet  connection. The webservice  supports a lot of diagram types, such as
PlantUML  (dia=plantuml),  Graphviz  (dia=graphviz),  Mermaid (dia=mermaid) or
Ditaa (dia=ditaa) and many others.

Here we provie just two examples, one for Ditaa diagram:

```{.kroki label=ditaa app=wget ext=svg eval=true echo=true dia=ditaa}
+----------------------------------------+
| File | Help   cEEE                     |
+-------------+--------------------------+
|  ttk.Button | ttk.Combobox             |
+-------------+--------------------------+
|             |                          |
| tk.Listbox  | tk.Text                  |
|             |                          |
|            <+>                         |
|             |                          |
|             |                          |
|             |                          |
+-------------+--------+-----------------+
| ttk.Label            | ttk.Progressbar | 
+----------------------+-----------------+
```

And here an example for a Mermaid diagram:


```{.kroki label=mermaid app=wget ext=svg eval=true echo=true dia=mermaid}
