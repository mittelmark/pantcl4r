## Introduction

_pantcl4r_ is a simple R only  package  which uses only standard R packages, so has no
external dependency except for the tools you might want to integrate into your
Markdown  document. It is thought as fast simple  drop-in  replacement  for the
RMarkdown package in cases where you can't install all the required tools and
packages easily for instance if you are working on a kiosk-mode  computer like
in the seminar rooms of the  University. It is not fully  compatible  yet with
R-Markdown so should be mainly used for demonstration purposes.

Below you find example code for the package pantcl4r for different programming
or diagram  languages  like R, Python,  Tcl, C++,  GraphViz  dot,  PlantUML or
diagram languages supported by the kroki web service. 

## Document processing

The  idea  of the  process  is that  you  create  a file  with  embedded  code
statements  and then the file is  converted  to a HTML file where the embedded
statements are executed and the results of the code execution is added as well
to the output. That way you can combine  your text for your  article or thesis
with R code and  updating  your results is very easy in case your data gets an
update. So the pipeline  within your R console using the function  `pantcl` of
the pantcl4r package is as follows:

```

+-------------+                                         +--------------+   
|             |  pantcl('article.Rmd','article.html')   |              |
| article.Rmd +---------------------------------------->| article.html |  
|             |                                         |              |
+-------------+                                         +--------------+
```


## R examples

Let's start with a simple print  statement  using R (replace the triple single
quotes with triple backticks in the examples below, the single quotes are used
to avoid inpterpretation by the package for the code examples

```
'''{r}
x=1
print(x)
'''
```

This is the output:

```{r}
x=1
print(x)
```

Using the code chunk option `echo=FALSE` we can avoid showing the source code.

```
'''{r echo=FALSE}
x=1
print(x)
'''
```

This is the output:

```{r echo=FALSE}
x=1
print(x)
```

To even hide the output you could use the optin  `results="hide"`.  That would
allow you to perform some  computations but hide the details in the ouput. For
instance in a scientific  article you only like to present the results but not
exactly how they are computed.

```
'''{r echo=FALSE results="hide"}
x=x+1
print(x)
'''
```

Here the result:

```{r echo=FALSE results="hide"}
x=x+1
print(x)
```

You should see ... Nothing! But x is now: `r x`!

Now we continue  with a simple plot, the easiest way is to open a png and later
add the Markdown code for the image.

```
 '''{r}
 png("iris.png",width=800,height=500)
 data(iris)
 par(mfrow=c(1,2),mai=rep(0.8,4))
 plot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Sepal.Length,
     col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
 plot(iris$Petal.Width~iris$Petal.Length,
    col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
 dev.off()
 '''

 ! [] (iris.png) (remove spaces)
```

Here is the output:

```{r eval=TRUE}
png("iris.png",width=800,height=500)
data(iris)
par(mfrow=c(1,2),mai=rep(0.8,4))
plot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Sepal.Length,
    col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
plot(iris$Petal.Width~iris$Petal.Length,
    col=as.numeric(iris$Species)+1,pch=15)
dev.off()
```

![](iris.png)

Let's  continue with a little  table. The  package  comes with a
command  df2md which can be used to display  Data Frames and  Matrices. If you
have the knitr package installed you could as well use knitr:kable instead.

```
'''{r results="asis"}
df2md(head(iris))
'''
```

See especially the code chunk option `results="asis"` which indicates that the
putput  should be embedded  already as Markdown  code ready for  conversion to
HTML. Here the result:


```{r results="asis"}
df2md(head(iris))
```


## Lorem Lipsum 

Sometimes we would like to add some place holder text like Lorem  Lipsum. You
can do this by writing: `'r cat(lipsum(paragraphs=2)'`  (replace single quotes
with backticks. Here the output:

`r cat(lipsum(paragraphs=2))`

## In Text R Expressions

Last but not  least, often  you like to inline  R-expressions  in your text to
display results of R commands directly within your text.

```
The dataset iris has `r nrow(iris)` plants.
```

gives:

The dataset iris has `r nrow(iris)` plants.w

__To summarize this section. We have either:__

- __code chunks__ in triple backticks fenced code block mainly used to create figures and tables
- __inline code__  expressions  with single  backticks to embed results within the
normal text

The following code chunk arguments were discussed:

- echo - show the code chunk code, default: TRUE
- results - show the results (default: 'show', possible as well 'hide' or 'asis'

## Equations

Since version 0.5.0 the package as well supports equations in two forms inline
equations  within  parenthesis  which must be protected by two backslashes and
block  equations  which are  enclosed by brackets as well  protected  with two
backslashes to allow the substitutions:

So equations can be written  either within  parenthesis  were the opening and the
closing parenthesis must be prefixed with two backslashes.

Example  of an  inline  equation __&bsol;&bsol;&bsol;&bsol;( E = mc^2 &bsol;&bsol;&bsol;&bsol;)__  gives: \\( E = mc^2 \\). You  write  these
equations either within two parenthesis. 

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).

Inline equation can be as well more complex: 

```
\\(\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}\\)
```

gives  \\(\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 =  \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}\\)  within a normal text
line.

Writing  equations in its own block  requires  embedding  them within  brackets
protected  with two  backslashes or using two dollar signs to start end to end
an equation like this:

```
\\[ equation \\]

$$  equation  $$

```

Here the formula  shown above but now within its own block and numbered  using
the tag command.

So here the input:

```
\\[ \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 =  \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6} \tag{1} \\] 
```

and here the output:

\\[ \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 =  \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6} \tag{1} \\] 

As you can see the  alignment  to the  center  does not  really  look nice. So
there is style  command for the  division tag of class left which aligns the equation to the
left which is probably  better to read. So you wrap your equation  within this
div tag to make it left aligned:

&lt;div class="left"&gt;

\$\$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6} \tag{2}\$\$

&lt;/div&gt;


And here the output:

<div class="left">
$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6} \tag{2}$$
</div>

That probably looks better than a centered  equation with the numbering at the
very end.


## Graphviz example

The  following  code  requires  the  GraphViz  tools to be  available  and the
applications  dot or neato must be  available  in one folder  belonging to the
PATH  variable.  Usually on a Linux system you install  these tools using your
package manager like this:

```
### Fedora
sudo dnf install graphviz
### Debian systems like Ubuntu
sudo apt install graphviz
```

After you installed these tools you can embed and display GraphViz code within
your Markdown  documents  like this (triple  backticks  instead of the leading
single quotes):

```{.dot eval=FALSE}
'''{.dot eval=TRUE}
digraph { 
    node[style=filled,fillcolor=skyblue];
    rankdir="LR";
    A -> B; 
}
'''
```

You can achieve the same using the kroki  webservice which does not need local
tools to be installed ike this:

```
'''{.kroki dia=graphviz,eval=TRUE}
digraph { 
    node[style=filled,fillcolor=skyblue];
    rankdir="LR";
    A -> B; 
}
'''
```

Here the result, but with echo=FALSE to hide the code:

```{.kroki dia=graphviz,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
digraph { 
    node[style=filled,fillcolor=skyblue];
    rankdir="LR";
    A -> B; 

}
```


## PlantUML code

The  following  code  requires  the [PlantUML](https://www.plantuml.com) application  and the  executable
_plantuml_  must be  available in one folder  belonging to the PATH  variable.
Usually on a Linux system you install  these tools using your package  manager
like this:

```
### Fedora
sudo dnf install plantuml
### Debian systems like Ubuntu
sudo apt install plantuml
```

After you installed  this tool you can embed and display  PlantUML code within
your Markdown documents like this:

```{.puml eval=FALSE}
@startuml
class A { }
class B { }
class C { }
A -> B 
B - C
@enduml
```

Again you can use the kroki webservice for this diagram type:

```{.kroki dia=plantuml,eval=TRUE}
@startuml
class A { }
class B { }
class C { }
A -> B 
B - C
@enduml
```

## Python example

```{.pipe pipe="python3" eval=TRUE}
print("Hello Python 2023\n",flush=True)
for i in range(0,5):
    print(i,flush=True)
```

Inline Python: After the loop the variable value of i is `py i`!

## Kroki Diagrams

The  [Kroki](https://kroki.io/)  webservices  allows  you to  create  diagrams
without  installing  software  on your own  machine  and  should  work with an
internet  connection. The webservice  supports a lot of diagram types, such as
PlantUML  (dia=plantuml),  Graphviz  (dia=graphviz),  Mermaid (dia=mermaid) or
Ditaa (dia=ditaa) and many others.

Here we provie just two examples, one for Ditaa diagram:

```{.kroki label=ditaa app=wget ext=svg eval=true echo=true dia=ditaa}
+----------------------------------------+
| File | Help   cEEE                     |
+-------------+--------------------------+
|  ttk.Button | ttk.Combobox             |
+-------------+--------------------------+
|             |                          |
| tk.Listbox  | tk.Text                  |
|             |                          |
|            <+>                         |
|             |                          |
|             |                          |
|             |                          |
+-------------+--------+-----------------+
| ttk.Label            | ttk.Progressbar | 
+----------------------+-----------------+
```

And here an example for a Mermaid diagram:


```{.kroki label=mermaid app=wget ext=svg eval=true echo=true dia=mermaid}
graph TD
  A[ Anyone ] -->|Can help | B( Go to github.com/yuzutech/kroki )
  B --> C{ How to contribute? }
  C --> D[ Reporting bugs ]
  C --> E[ Sharing ideas ]
  C --> F[ Advocating ]
```

## References

The package as well  supports  the  inclusion of  references  using the ref
syntax. At first you must  declare a reference  file either in the yaml header
like this: 

```
---
...
author: ...
bibliography: ref.bib
---
```

Let's give a few examples:

The package  pantcl4r  [@pantcl4r]  was written by Detlef  Groth. There are as
well a few interesting papers like [@Groth2019] and [@Hermanussen2021].

Thereafter you can display the references:
